 NeighbourShare – A Community Borrow & Buy Console App (Python)

NeighbourShare is a simple Python-based console program designed to help people living in the same area (such as hostel students or residents in the same building) borrow or buy items from one another.
The project shows basic problem solving using beginner-level Python programming concepts.
